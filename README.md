# __*cloud__ - FileLink for Nextcloud and ownCloud

A MailExtension for Thunderbird (68+) that uploads large attachments to your
Cloud and generates a link you can send by mail instead of the file.

* [Users](#user-content-user-guide)
* [Admins](#user-content-cloud-admin-guide)
* [Developers](#user-content-developer-guide)

## Requirements

* Nextcloud: 16 or newer (older versions might work, but are [not supported by
  Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule))
* ownCloud: 10+ (older versions might work, but are [not supported by
  ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/maintenance-and-release-schedule)
* Thunderbird: 68+ (60.5+ might work, but has not been tested)

## User guide

### Installation

__*cloud__ is available via [Thunderbird's Add-on
repository](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/filelink-nextcloud-owncloud/).
1. Install it directly from the Add-ons management within Thunderbird.
1. Go to Settings -> Attachments -> Sending to configure your Nextcloud or
   ownCloud account.

### Password vs. App Token

Instead of storing your password it's more secure to use an "App Token " with
__*cloud__. There are two ways to get such a token:

* *If you are using Nextcloud or ownCloud:* Open your account in the browser and
  go to Settings -> Security -> App Token and at the bottom of the page generate
  a new token. Copy&paste it into the "App token" field of the Attachments preferences page in
  Thunderbird.

* *Only if you are using Nextcloud:* Type your regular user password into the
  Attachments preferences page in Thunderbird. Upon saving, the Add-On will
  *try* to get a token from your Nextcloud and use it instead of your password.
  You will notice the change, because afterwards the password field is filled
  with dots completely (app tokens are quite long).\
  **BUT!** if getting the token fails for any reason (e.g. your Nextcloud is not
  reachable, timeout, wrong username, ...), the Add-On will *store your password
  unencrypted*.

### Handling of existing files

 * If you attach a file that's already in the attachments folder in your cloud *with identical contents*,
that file is not uploaded again. Instead the existing file is shared.\
You can use this, if you want to share large (or many) files: Sync your
attachments folder to a folder on your computer using the desktop client. If you
then attach a synced file from your computer to a message, __*cloud__ will
notice that it's already uploaded. This might not work with uploads from the
mobile clients, but I haven't tested it.

 * If you attach a file with the same name but different contents as a cloud file, the cloud file will not be overwritten. Instead __*cloud__ moves the existing file to a subfolder of the attachments folder; the original share link will remain valid and point to the old content.\
 Then the new file is uploaded and shared with a new share link.

__*cloud__ uses the same method as the
Nextcloud/ownCloud desktop clients to decide if the local and remote files are
identical. 

### Known issues

#### Only one download password for all uploads

In Thunderbird's concept of FileLink Add-Ons the preferences panel is the only
means of user interaction. So there is currently no supported way to ask the
user for an individual download password or show a generated one. It might be
feasible by unofficial methods. But that solution might break, whenever
Thunderbirds API changes -- and as of early 2020 it changes frequently.

**Workaround:** Change the download password in the preferences pane or use
multiple accounts with different passwords.

#### Attaching files from SMB shares

If you attach a file from a SMB share, it's uploaded to the cloud and the share link is inserted into your mail, but still the file is attached to the message. This is not a bug in __*cloud__ but a [known bug in Thunderbird](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793118). There is nothing I can do about it in __*cloud__, sorry.

**Workaround:** Copy the file from the SMB share to your local disk before attaching it.

#### Upload problems

* The *download* password has to comply to the rules for passwords on your
  cloud, otherwise the *upload* will fail. There are default rules of Nextcloud
  and ownCloud, and your admin might have configured some different rules. 
* If all uploads fail, it might be a problem with the settings in your Nextcloud or
  ownCloud (point your admin to the [Admin guide](#user-content-nextcloud-admin-guide)).
* If the Add-On still fails, please check if it's a [known bug](https://gitlab.com/joendres/filelink-nextcloud/-/boards). Feel free to open a new issue otherwise.

#### Old files are not deleted 

Thunderbird and __*cloud__ don't know, if a shared file has been downloaded, so
they cannot decide which files are obsolete. You have to clean up your
attachments folder yourself, sorry.

## Cloud admin guide

Some settings in Nextcloud/ownCloud are relevant for this Add-On:

* **Settings -> Sharing -> Allow apps to use the Share API** has to be enabled
  (*mandatory*)
* **Settings -> Sharing -> Allow users to share via link** has to be enabled
  (*mandatory*)
* **Settings -> Sharing -> Allow users to share via link -> Enforce password
  protection** might result in confusing error messages to users, because the
  *upload* in Thunderbird fails if an invalid password is requested. Be prepared
  for questions, if you enable this. (*optionally off*)
