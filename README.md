## User guide

### Installation

FileLink Provider for Nextcloud will shortly be available from https://addons.thunderbird.net/de/thunderbird/. Until then download the [XPI file](raw/master/web-ext-artifacts/filelink_provider_for_nextcloud-2.0.0.xpi) and install it manually.

### Account settings

### Password vs. App Token

FileLink Provider for Nextcloud tries, not to store your Nextcloud password, but to use an "App Token" instead. There ist two ways to get such a token:

1. Open your Nextcloud account in the browser and go to Settings -> -> Security -> App Token and at the bottom of the page generate a new one. Copy&paste it into the "App token" field of the configuration in Thunderbird.

1. Type your password into the Filelink configuration page in Thunderbird. Upon saving, the Add-On will *try* to get a token from your Nextcloud and use it instead of your password. You will notice the change, because afterwards the password field is completely filled with dots (app tokens are quite long).\
**BUT!** if getting the token fails for any reason (eg. Nextcloud not reachable, timeout, wrong username, ...), the Add-On will *store your Nextcloud password unencrypted*.

_Summary:_ Letting the Add-On get an a app token is more convenient, but may fail resulting in your *password beeng stored unencrypted*. Supplying your own token is a little bit more secure, but inconvenient.
