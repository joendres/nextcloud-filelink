# FileLink Provider for Nextcloud

A MailExtension f√ºr Thunderbird (68+) that uploads large attachments to your Nextcloud instead of sending them by email.

Heavily based on [FileLink Provider for Dropbox](https://github.com/darktrojan/dropbox) by [Geoff Lankow](https://darktrojan.github.io/) and [Nextcloud for Filelink](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-filelink).
